 * Typical causes:
 *  - the user revoked our app (myaccount.google.com / account.microsoft.com)
 *  - the refresh token went idle past the provider's TTL (Google: 6 months; Microsoft: 90 days)
 *  - the user changed their password (some account configurations)
 *  - the OAuth client itself was rotated/deleted at the provider
 *
 * Distinct from generic OAuth failures because the recovery is different: the local
 * EmailAccount row is now garbage and should be deleted, NOT retried. Callers in
 * `EmailAccountsService` catch this specifically and self-heal by deleting the row.

/**
 * Thrown when a Microsoft Entra OAuth redirect comes back with an "admin consent required"
 * error code — the user attempted to connect a mailbox that lives in a work tenant whose
 * admin has disabled user-level consent for Mail.* scopes.
 *
 * Distinct from a generic OAuth `error` because the recovery is product-specific: the
 * tenant admin must approve our app once for the whole tenant via the `/adminconsent`
 * endpoint, after which any user in that tenant can connect. We surface a structured
 * code so the web client can render a "send your admin this link" CTA instead of the
 * generic "the provider returned an error" Alert.
 *
 * Detected by matching `error_description` against the known Entra error codes:
 *  - `AADSTS65001` — user or admin has not consented (org-wide user-consent disabled)
 *  - `AADSTS90094` — admin permission required for this scope
 *  - `AADSTS900971` — no reply address (admin-consent variant)
 *
 * Carries an `adminConsentUrl` so the controller doesn't have to rebuild it.

 *
 * Caught by `EmailAccountsService.withFreshAccessToken`, which forces a refresh (which
 * may surface `OAuthRefreshTokenInvalidException` → row deletion + 404) and retries the
